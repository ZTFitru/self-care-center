## Context:

- This was a solo project I completed on week 3, while attending at Turing. I was tasked to recreate what the app would look like from a screenshot image provided. I was also provided with the fonts, colors and an image. This project was to test my understanding of HTML, CSS and JavaScript. HTML and CSS helped me bring out the visual aspect of the page and I used JS to make it interactive for the user.
